# DateAPI

An API for Persian Calendar events and holidays.

This is a young project to answer the need of lacking a complete API for persian calendar events and holidays.

There are some similar works, but they all have problems and are not open-source so I can not help improve them.

# How to use

This project is hosted on [DateAPI.ir](https://dateapi.ir)

Documentations on how to use it exists under this link: [Documentations](https://dateapi.ir/docs)

# TODO (Open to any contributions)

- [x] Add verification to API inputs.
- [x] Add timestamp conversions to the APIs.
- [ ] Create a suitable homepage.
- [ ] Move events.json file to a database so it is queriable and more efficient.
- [ ] Make date conversion process more abstract to have a more clean code. (Create suitable functions in tools/tools.js maybe and use them).
- [ ] Add day of week (sat,sun,mon,etc) [#5](https://gitlab.com/molaeiali/date-api/-/issues/5)
